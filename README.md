This repository contains the Power BI project file (.pbix) and the dataset used for my latest project on Amazon sales analysis. The project offers an interactive dashboard showcasing sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability metrics.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Sales breakdown by segment and market
Profit analysis by customer name
Top 5 profit and loss insights by product
Key performance indicators tracking total orders, returns, product units sold, and sales projections
Feel free to explore the dashboard and dataset. Let's connect to discuss how these insights can benefit your business!
